                    <p>
                        An Ocala native, Adam began his fitness journey at the
                        age of 13 after discovering his love for weight
                        training. He competed in weightlifting competitions in
                        high school and became a certified personal trainer
                        while attending Florida State University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout his fitness journey, Adam incurred numerous
                        injuries including herniated discs, tendinitis, and a
                        ruptured pectoral muscle. Though these injuries were
                        mentally frustrating, Adam came to learn that receiving
                        regular massage and body work would help prevent injury,
                        improve muscle growth and healing, and help him get back
                        to what he loved best - training.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After competing in a bodybuilding show in 2015, Adam
                        broadened his fitness routine, incorporating yoga,
                        Pilates, cycling, and circuit training. Each program
                        taught him a little bit more about the body, its true
                        biomechanical function, and most importantly, the need
                        to rest, recover and heal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this vast amount of knowledge and experience in the
                        fitness industry, Adam became a licensed massage
                        therapist and opened the Revival Cave to help others
                        heal and perform at their best.
