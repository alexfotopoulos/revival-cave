                                An Ocala native, Adam began his fitness journey
                                at the age of 13 after discovering his love for
                                weight training. He competed in weightlifting
                                competitions in high school and became a
                                certified personal trainer while attending
                                Florida State University.
                            </p>
                            <p className={styles.bioParagraph}>
                                Throughout his fitness journey, Adam incurred
                                numerous injuries including herniated discs,
                                tendinitis, and a ruptured pectoral muscle.
                                Though these injuries were mentally frustrating,
                                Adam came to learn that receiving regular
                                massage and body work would help prevent injury,
                                improve muscle growth and healing, and help him
                                get back to what he loved best - training.
                            </p>
                            <p className={styles.bioParagraph}>
                                After competing in a bodybuilding show in 2015,
                                Adam broadened his fitness routine,
                                incorporating yoga, Pilates, cycling, and
                                circuit training. Each program taught him a
                                little bit more about the body, its true
                                biomechanical function, and most importantly,
                                the need to rest, recover and heal.

                                experience in the fitness industry, Adam became
                                a licensed massage therapist and opened the
                                Revival Cave to help others heal and perform at

                                Saint Petersburg, Andy began his fitness journey
                                growing up doing school sports such as soccer,
                                track, cross country, and volleyball. While
                                growing up Andy was a very active kid. He fell
                                in love with martial arts at a young age and
                                through the years has trained and competed in
                                disciplines such as Judo, Muay Thai, Boxing,
                                Tang Soo Do, Jiujitsu, Kungfu, Aikido, and

                                United States Marine Corps after graduation.
                                Joining the service tested his mental fortitude
                                and physical capabilities in stressful
                                conditions. While in the service, he was a

                                After his time in the service, he fell in love
                                with fitness, pushing his limits to see what his
                                peak performance was. He competed in various
                                Judo and Jiujitsu tournaments in his later
                                years. After sustaining many injuries from the
                                service and competitions, he switched gears and
                                decided to dedicate his purpose to healing others.
