    bio: ["Originating from New York, Ariana began her skincare journey at a young age after struggling with acne and eczema. Her skin challenges led her to become deeply invested in understanding skin health, even undergoing patch testing at a dermatologist's office after a severe eczema reaction. Through persistence and research, Ariana gradually gained control over her skin concerns, transforming what began as a personal struggle into a professional passion.", "While helping family and friends with their skincare and shaping their eyebrows, Ariana discovered her talent for helping others feel confident in their own skin. Though her early skin issues were mentally frustrating, Ariana came to learn that proper skincare techniques could not only heal but also prevent future problems, leading her to pursue professional training. After becoming a licensed medical aesthetician, Ariana expanded her expertise to include specialized treatments like facials, back facials, SWiCH treatments, dermaplaning, and high-frequency therapy. Each new technique taught her more about skin health, its natural functions, and most importantly, how to help clients both heal and maintain their skin's vitality. With this combination of personal experience and professional training, Ariana recently joined the team at Revival Cave with a mission to help clients feel comfortable, heard, and confident in their own skin.", "When not transforming clients' skin, Ariana enjoys painting, finding parallels between the artistry in both skincare and canvas work."]
