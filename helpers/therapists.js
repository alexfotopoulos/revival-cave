I have a passion for helping people feel their best— whether it's through deep tissue work, relaxation techniques, or injury recovery.", "When I'm not in the treatment room, you'll find me out exploring the world: hiking scenic trails, skiing fresh powder, kayaking quiet waters, or planning my next adventure.

    bio: ["Born and raised in St. Petersburg, Florida, Alec Gamble (AG), is a dedicated pain therapy specialist with a deep passion for helping people move better and live pain-free. His journey into bodywork began after a traumatic basketball injury that left him struggling with chronic pain. After trying multiple approaches without success, it was a skilled therapist using hands-on bodywork that finally brought him lasting relief. That experience changed the course of his life, igniting a drive to understand pain, healing, and the incredible resilience of the human body. AG now specializes in treating chronic pain, postural dysfunction, and restricted movement using neurosomatic therapy and neurofascial release. With each session, he works directly with the body's fascia and nervous system, using precise techniques to release tension, correct alignment, and restore function. He incorporates breathwork, movement, and postural education to help clients not only feel better but stay better. Alec brings nearly two years of experience and dedicated clinical study to the table. His personal connection to pain and healing gives him a unique sense of empathy and insight that clients immediately feel. Every session is an opportunity to bring someone closer to relief, and that's what drives him every day."]
